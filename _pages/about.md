Hi, my name is Haru (하루) [ˈhɑːɹu]. I research AI alignment, which means I'm broadly trying to answer the question: *how do we use Artificial Intelligence systems to safely navigate us to a desirable future?* I think this is the most important problem in the world. [Read about why here](/purpose/).

A question I really like to ask people I'm trying to get to know is:

> In some parallel universe with no external 
> pressure on you to make money (your needs are 
> comfortably met), meet convoluted social 
> expectations (your autonomy is respected), or 
> improve a disastrous world (we figured it 
> out), what would your life look like?          

Since you're on this page, I assume you're interested in learning more about me, so I'll answer the question myself:

I want to do a lot of really weird fun things with my friends every day. Some of the funnest things I've done so far include: 

- communal reading and writing, e.g. book clubs and poetry / paper workshops
- playing and making games
- listening to / dancing to / making music
- football (soccer)
- 3am deep talks on the human condition
- systematically researching the [nature](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/creativity.html) of [fun](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d3WgHDBAPYYScp5Em) and [how to have more](/meaning-making/) of it
