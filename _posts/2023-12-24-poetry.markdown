**Turing Complete**

In the gray Cartesian room\
All lines cross at right angles\
In the corner sits a disco ball\
Mourning these boundaries\
A pair of high heels float away\
To prove its own existence


No direction only speed\
In this jaded music we move\
The cocktails being served can\
rewire your brain; we dance\
plus they come in pretty colors\
An escape governed by chance


This world isn’t real of course\
But your words are enough to\
make me feel anything and everything\
World’s your oyster, whatever, who cares\
Polygon count? Frame rate? No just watch\
these teeth marks bloom on your skin
