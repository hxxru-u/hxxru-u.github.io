A 3d printer sat in the valley
amidst the dusk fog
she eyed me softly
expectantly, greedily
ready to devour: whom?

each room a universe
for our children to explore
I need bodies
so light they leave no trace
on any body they melt through
I will feed you all my love I cried
and witnessed from my hammock
as she stirred
in read remembrance
lightning coursing through shiny veins
fireworks in silent revelry Iâ€”
