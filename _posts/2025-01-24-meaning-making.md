excerpt: "My take on art and meaning."
dropcap: true

Here are my thoughts on *what art is*, and why it is so fundamental to my worldview.

Basic outline:

-Art as labeled, communicated information

-(Somewhat) Optimized for compressibility: introduce Schmidhuber, Dopamine RPE Coding

-"Meaningfulness" is subjective because your brain is your own!

-Art in broader culture

-Pedagogy, etc...
