excerpt: "Why do anything at all?"

Why live? Why do anything at all?

Growing up, I wanted to be an Astrophysicist because I thought space was cool.
Then I went to college. I studied physics and made friends. 

As I learned how the world worked, I got more and more confused because the world was weird, the people were weird, and nobody had any idea what was going on. 




We dug up some rocks up from the ground and arranged them to make them think for us. 

In a world where there were no thinking rocks, in a world where you aren't reading these words off of your thinking rock: 

Would you even consider computers as a possibility?
The answer is: of course not!
