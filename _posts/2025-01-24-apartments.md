**SEUNG-YEOL PARK (b. 1993)**
*tr. Haru Kim*

apartments on apartments on apartments make a forest and i saw a buffalo walk amongst it all children watched the buffalo with curious eyes as it trudged lazily between the numerous apartments but the children soon left as the sky darkened and that night i listened to the footsteps of the buffalo now illuminated by street lamps the footsteps were loud yet nobody seemed bothered even as the sun started to rise nobody did as much to stick their head out the window

i could reconstructed the scene in my head from the footsteps i heard

no i actually watched it happen with my own eyes

the next day i walked amongst the apartments but there was no buffalo only a dozen or so mice they stared directly at me seemingly menacing but i thought they meant no harm the mice left eventually and i was alone again walking deeper and deeper within the apartments i did not expect to see the buffalo again

and all of that was an year ago so i have no idea why a buffalo is lounging in our living room today i look at the buffalo and it is walking around the room my husband asks me why im standing so still *shouldnt we be taking that thing out of the house* he says and i nod but i keep watching the buffalo it is still going around and around i want it to spin until it dissolves into a whirlpool but no such thing happens 

the buffalo merely walks around and around making a mess of our living room
