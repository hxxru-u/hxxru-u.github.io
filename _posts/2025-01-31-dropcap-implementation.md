Typography has always been a cornerstone of good web design. This post documents how I implement dropcaps on my site, heavily inspired by [Gwern's excellent work](https://gwern.net/dropcap). Using his SVG and TTF assets, I'm rendering dropcaps on my Jekyll deployed page (Gwern uses Hakyll for his site). 

## Motivation

I don't know all that much about web typography (or web development in general). Most I've ever forayed into that corner of knowledge is to come across typography [mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO83KQuuZvg&t=414s) by [coding nerds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y65FRxE7uMc) that I learn from.

What I do have, however, is an appreciation of things that are pretty. Especially when that things is cleverly engineered and optimized, whether it be a song, an outfit, a theory of everything (link to post here later), or a website. When I came across [Gwern's article about cats](https://gwern.net/cat-knocking) that *starts with a [CAT dropcap](https://gwern.net/dropcap#dropcat)*, I shed a tear of joy. I'm not at the level of trying to generate new SVG dropcap font files using a custom workflow like him, but it was obvious to me that I should at least implement dropcaps at all (even if I stole them from Gwern). In a good future, I'll have enough powerful aligned AIs that can streamline a process for auto-generating a relevant dropcap based on the content of a post.
