How do our TTF dropcaps look? This post starts with 'H', which isn't available in our SVG set, so it should fall back to using the Goudy Initialen TTF version.

Regular paragraphs should continue normally after the dropcap. This helps us verify the spacing and flow of text around the TTF dropcap.

And here's a final paragraph to ensure everything looks consistent throughout the post.
