Galileo and Giraffe and I were walking home from work & it was a gig in the nicer part of the city we had just started as line cooks at this fancy restaurant that none of our friends would ever go to, we were learning that Friday evenings were twice as busy as usual with order after order of SALAMANDER SOUPE and pepperoni pizza—our patrons were gracious paying 10× markup for the vintage house wine 
which we knew was poured straight out of a box = not entirely unlike tapping sap with a spile


salamander heads in the compost snuggling like peas in a pod


kitchen work was especially hard for Giraffe who was 14±2 feet tall. she was developing neck pains due to having to look down for 8 hours a day while Galileo sustained an injury because he intentionally dropped a MEAT MALLET on his foot (*to test my theory of falling bodies he explained* but I had a sneaking suspicion it was to get out of work early) he limped struggling to keep up while I explained the nuances of worker’s comp
but he wasn’t really listening he was transfixed by planes passing overhead blinking bioluminescent
I told him they were metal birds *friendly ones even give rides!*

which he thought was ridiculous (*assurdo!*)


Giraffe, a philosopher by training and by far the smartest of all of us, was convinced that we weren’t where we were supposed to be / she kept repeating *we aren’t where we are* even as we got ready for bed she said *why am I so tall* as she curled up into a ball still barely fitting onto her custommade bed / I told her a bedtime story about three little sheep to help her fall asleep / when her breathing turned even I draped the blanket we got her for her birthday (it was the biggest Galileo and I managed to find at IKEA) over her / I hope she was having the sweetest of dreams somewhere with more green


Galileo was still outside watching the metal birds not fall to the ground


after I tucked Giraffe in I folded my laundry
& listened to raindrops drumming the window while licking my scales clean 

they felt very sturdy
