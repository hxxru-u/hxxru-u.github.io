Hi, my name is Haru Kim. I am in my last semester at Williams College. I study Physics and Computer Science, broadly interested in the science of optimization. I do research at the [Williams College Material Physics Lab](https://sites.williams.edu/materials/) advised by Prof. Kate Jensen.

Outside of my current research in physics, I am interested in thinking about utopias that people would actually want to live in.
