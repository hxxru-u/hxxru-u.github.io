+This repo is a personal website built on jekyll and deployed on github oages. I've implemented a simple game of life animation in the background. game-advanced.html has the game logic. I want to build on top of this game logic to create an interactive post showcasing various interesting game of life phenomena, including the very basics (which is included in the post already). I am thinking of adding interactive "playground" windows within the post, which will require creating some new files, likely layout html files, then use that to write the post. Does this make sense? Let me know if you require access to other files

+Let's continue with the changes. I think the playground should allow the user to click to toggle cells within the canvas of the game, this may require modifying the underlying game logic itself too

+An issue: the game does not render. perhaps because of the layout of the blog post? I see in plaintext: <div class=”game-playground” data-pattern=””[[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1]]”” data-config=””{"cellSize": 30}””> in the rendered post

+Doesn't seem to work. Could you make a new layout file that allows for integreation of the game-playground? I think the current issue is that the single.html that is used for blog posts doesn't seem to work with our includes/game-playground

+It's still not rendering. Try to debug step by step.
